A unit is a metric scale but here in blockchain cryptocurrency, it refers to a denomination. Ether units are denominations that are used to pay for computational processes within EVM. In Solidity programming, a unit is a measurement of value or time that is used in the code.

There are two types of units in Solidity: <br/>
1. Ether Units:
* Ether units are used to represent value, such as the amount of money being transferred between accounts or the cost of a transaction. 
* Ether, like many other cryptocurrencies, can be divided into smaller units of value. 
* The smallest unit of ether is called a wei, and there are 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1 quintillion) Wei in one ether.

| Unit | Wei Value | Wei |
|---|---|---|
| wei | 1 | 1 |
| Kwei (babbage) | 1e3 wei | 1,000 |
| Mwei (lovelace) | 1e6 wei | 1,000,000 |
| Gwei (shannon) | 1e9 wei | 1,000,000,000 |
| microether (szabo) | 1e12 wei | 1,000,000,000,000 |
| milliether (finney) | 1e15 wei | 1,000,000,000,000,000 |
| ether | 1e18 wei | 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 |

2. Time Units:
* Time units, on the other hand, are used to measure the duration of certain events in the blockchain, such as the amount of time that must pass before a certain action is allowed to occur. 
* Solidity provides several time units that can be used in your code, including:
1. seconds (s)
2. minutes (min)
3. hours (h)
4. days (days)
5. weeks (weeks)
