An interface is a mechanism to achieve abstraction.

Following are the key characteristics of an interface-
* Interface can not have any function with implementation.
* Functions of an interface can be only of type external.
* Interface can not have constructor.
* Interface can not have state variables.
* Interface can have enum, structs which can be accessed using interface name dot notation.
* We have to override the functions declared in an interface in the current contract.
