In Solidity, the "super" keyword can be used in an inherited contract to refer to the contract that it is inheriting from. This can be useful when you want to call a function in the base contract from within a function in the inherited contract.

Parent contracts can be called directly, or by using the keyword super.

By using the keyword "super", all of the immediate parent contracts will be called.
