While writing a contract, we may encounter a situation where we need to perform an action over and over again. In such situations, we would need to write loop statements to reduce the number of lines.

There are 3 types of loops in solidity:
1. for loop
2. while loop
3. do...while loop

for loop is the most used/preferred loop, because it is bounded.

while and do...while loops comes under unbounded loops category and this could hit the gas limit, causing our transaction to fail and draining our eth balance and that is why these 2 loops are rarely used.
